# End-to-End-Pneumonia detection using MLflow and DVC

#Objective
The goal of this project is to develop, track, and deploy a pneumonia detection model using chest X-ray images. The model is built using DenseNet121 for high-accuracy feature extraction and classification. The entire workflow integrates MLflow for experiment tracking, DVC for data and pipeline management, and AWS CICD for automated deployment.
